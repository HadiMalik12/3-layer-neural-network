# Neural Network for Binary Classification

This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network for binary classification. The neural network is built from scratch using NumPy and includes methods for forward and backward propagation, as well as training using gradient descent.

## Description

The neural network consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It uses various activation functions such as tanh, sigmoid, and ReLU for non-linearity. Regularization is applied to prevent overfitting, and gradient descent is used to update the weights and biases during training.

## Usage

To use the neural network, follow these steps:
