# Neural Network for Binary Classification

## Description

The neural network consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. It uses various activation functions such as tanh, sigmoid, and ReLU for non-linearity. Regularization is applied to prevent overfitting, and gradient descent is used to update the weights and biases during training.
